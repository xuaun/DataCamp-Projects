# Project: Analyzing Industry Carbon Emissions
## Context and Questions to solve

- Using the product_emissions table, find the number of unique companies and their total carbon footprint PCF for each industry group, filtering for the most recent year in the database. The query should return three columns: industry_group, num_companies, and total_industry_footprint, with the last column being rounded to one decimal place. The results should be sorted by total_industry_footprint from highest to lowest values.

Note: Please ensure do not change the name of the DataFrame that the query results will be saved as - creating new cells in the notebook will rename the DataFrame (see image below). Make sure that your final solutions uses the name: carbon_emissions_by_industry.

SQL cell called carbon_emissions_by_industry
