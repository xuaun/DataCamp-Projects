# Project: Uncovering the World's Oldest Businesses
## Context and Questions to solve

### Understand the factors that help a business be timeless by answering these questions:

- What is the oldest business on each continent? Save your query as a DataFrame oldest_business_continent with four columns: continent, country, business, and year_founded in any order.

- How many countries per continent lack data on the oldest businesses? Does including new_businesses change this? Count the number of countries per continent missing business data, including new_businesses; store the results in a DataFrame count_missing with columns continent and countries_without_businesses.

- Which business categories are best suited to last many years, and on what continent are they? Store your answer in a DataFrame oldest_by_continent_category with the oldest founding year for each continent and category combination. It should contain three columns: continent, category, and year_founded, in that order.

Note: Creating new cells in the workbook will rename the DataFrame. Make sure your solutions use the correct name:Screenshot showing the naming of DataFrames for SQL
