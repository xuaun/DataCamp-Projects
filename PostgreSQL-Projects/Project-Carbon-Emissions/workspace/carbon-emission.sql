-- # When factoring heat generation required for the manufacturing and transportation of products, _Greenhouse gas emissions attributable to products, from food to sneakers to appliances, make up more than 75% of global emissions._ (`Source: The Carbon Catalogue https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01178-9`)
-- # 
-- # Our data, which is publicly available on nature.com, contains product carbon footprints (PCFs) for various companies. PCFs are the greenhouse gas emissions attributable to a given product, measured in CO<sub>2</sub> (carbon dioxide equivalent).
-- # <!--https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01178-9-->
-- # 
-- # This data is stored in a PostgreSQL database containing one table, `product_emissions`, which looks at PCFs by product as well as the stage of production that these emissions occurred. Here's a snapshot of what `product_emissions` contains in each column:

-- # | `operations_percent_total_pcf`       | `VARCHAR`   |
-- # | `downstream_percent_total_pcf`       | `VARCHAR`   |
-- # 
-- # You'll use this data to examine the carbon footprint of each industry in the dataset!
