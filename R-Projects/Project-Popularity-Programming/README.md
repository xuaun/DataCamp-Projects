# Project: Analyze the Popularity of Programming Languages
## Context and Questions to solve

### Discover the trends in the popularity of programming languages by answering the following questions:

- What percentage of questions are tagged with r per year? Save the result in a data frame, r_over_time, containing five columns: year, tag, num_questions, year_total, and percentage (proportion of r questions).

- What was the percentage of R questions for 2020? Save your answer as a numeric variable, r_percentage, expressed as a decimal.

- Identify the five programming language tags with the highest total number of questions asked between 2015 and 2020 (inclusive). Save the tag names as a character vector, highest_tags.

Bonus: try visualizing the data along the way!
