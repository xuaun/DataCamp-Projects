# Project: Exploring Trends in American Baby Names
## Context and Questions to solve

### Before you proceed, consider the assumption that a name is considered "Classic" if it appears in 50 or more years, and "Trendy" otherwise.

- List the first five names in alphabetical order and find out if each name is "Classic" or "Trendy." Save your query as a DataFrame name_types with three columns: first_name, sum, and popularity_type.

- What were the top 20 male names overall, and how did the name Paul rank? Save your query as a DataFrame top_20 with three columns: name_rank, first_name, and sum.

- Which female names appeared in both 1920 and 2020? Save your query as a DataFrame a_names with two columns: first_name, and total_occurrences.

Note: Creating new cells in the workbook will rename the DataFrame. Make sure your solutions use the correct name: notebook_screenshot
