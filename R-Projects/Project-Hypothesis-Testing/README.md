# Project: Hypothesis Testing with Men's and Women's Soccer Matches
## Context and Questions to solve

### Perform an appropriate hypothesis test to determine the p-value, and decide whether to reject the null hypothesis that the mean number of goals scored in women's international soccer matches is the same as men's. Use a 10% significance level.

Use Official FIFA World Cup matches after 2002-01-01, assuming each match is fully independent and team form is ignored.

- Store the p-value and the test result in a data frame called result_df, withp_val as the p-value and result as either the string "fail to reject" or "reject", based on the test outcome.
