# Project: Analyzing Motorcycle Part Sales
## Context and Questions to solve

### Find out how much Wholesale net revenue each product_line generated per month per warehouse in the dataset.

- The query should be saved as revenue_by_product_line using the SQL cell provided, and contain the following:
-- product_line,
-- month: displayed as 'June', 'July', and 'August',
-- warehouse, and
-- net_revenue: the sum of total minus the sum of payment_fee.

- The results should be sorted by product_line and month, followed by net_revenue in descending order.

Note: Please also ensure that you do not change the name of the DataFrame that the query result will be saved as - creating new cells in the workbook will produce a DataFrame with a different name. Make sure that your final solution uses the names provided: revenue_by_product_line (see image below).

SQL cell saving the query results as a pandas DataFrame called revenue_by_product_line
